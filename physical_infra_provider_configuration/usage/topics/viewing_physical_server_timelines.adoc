==== Viewing a Physical Server's Timeline
The Timeline is a tool that enables administrators to track the history of Physical Server state over time, including power activity, device addition, device removal and firmware changes. This can be useful to identify critical failures, system behavior patterns and audit user actions, making troubleshooting easier. +
You can see a Timeline with events for a specific Physical Server. To do this, you have to:

. Navigate to *Compute > Physical Infrastructure > Servers*.
. Select a Physical Server in the list.
. Click the *Monitoring* button in the menu.
. Click *Timelines*. This button is only clickable if events are available for this server. 
. Select the event types and the period in the options filter. Filters can be used to focus attention on specific messages across a time interval.
. Click *Apply*.

The events that match your filters will appear in the timeline. Event detail can be retreived by clicking each events to see their details.
