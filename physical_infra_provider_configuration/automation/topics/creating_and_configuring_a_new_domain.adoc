=== Creating and Configuring a new Domain

Cloud Forms provides a default domain describing the set of automated activities that are available to the operator out of the box.  To customize these activities or generate your own, you must create a new domain.  The previous example used the operation Physical Server Shutdown, but you can use any operation that is valid for the Physical server component, such as Physical Server Start. The example shows the process for executing the Power Off action for a physical server when a specific event is received from Lenovo XClarity Administrator.  Follow the steps below, to configure a new domain for automation.
